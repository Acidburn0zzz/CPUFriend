CPUFriend Installation & Usage
===================================

#### System Requirements
CPUFriend needs macOS ***v10.8*** or greater.

#### Installation
It's highly recommended to let the bootloader inject CPUFriend, otherwise you'll need [LiluFriend](https://github.com/PMheart/LiluFriend) to ensure CPUFriend will work properly.

#### Available kernel flags
Add `-cpufdbg` to enable debug logging (ONLY available in DEBUG binaries).

Add `-cpufoff` to disable CPUFriend entirely.

Add `-cpufbeta` to enable CPUFriend on unsupported OS versions.

#### Configuration
Use `CPUFriend/ResourceConverter.sh` to generate a working copy of either `CPUFriendProvider.kext` or `ssdt_data.dsl`. If you also have a SSDT generated by [ssdtPRGen.sh](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh) then you may need to merge them. I don't propose to add such support for the time being. So I suggest you use `CPUFriendProvider.kext` to store your customised data.

#### Usage of ResourceConverter.sh
````--kext "file"````
	Create `CPUFriendProvider.kext` with information provided by "file".
	
````--acpi "file"````
	Create `ssdt_data.dsl` with information provided by "file".

NOTE: The created kext/ssdt is located in the current working directory.
