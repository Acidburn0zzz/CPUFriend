CPUFriend
=========

A [Lilu](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu) plug-in kernel extension which injects power management data dynamically.

#### Notes
This repository should be compiled with [Lilu](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu) ***v1.2.0*** and greater, otherwise the compilation will be failed!

Note: ***Debug version of Lilu.kext should be put in the same folder as CPUFriend! And they should also be used together!***

#### Configuration
