CPUFriend
=========

A [Lilu](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu) plug-in kernel extension which injects power management data dynamically.

#### Notes
This repository should be compiled with [Lilu](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu) ***v1.1.6*** and greater, otherwise the compilation will be failed!

Note: ***Debug version of Lilu.kext should be put in the same folder as CPUFriend! And they should be also used together!***

#### Configuration
See [Instructions](https://github.com/PMheart/CPUFriend/blob/master/Instructions.md) for more details.

#### Support and discussion
I think only competent users should configure CPUFriend. I'm sorry that there's no support for the time being.
